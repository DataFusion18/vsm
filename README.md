# The Vaganov-Shashkin tree-ring growth model (VSM)

This repository provides the Vaganov-Shashkin tree-ring growth model (VSM) in MATLAB (Octave-compatible).  VSM, originally written in Fortran, mimics subdaily and daily resolution processes of cambial growth in trees as a function of soil moisture, air temperature, and insolation, with environmental forcing modeled as the principle of limiting factors.  Our re-implementation in a high level interpreted language, while sacrificing speed, provides opportunities to systematically evaluate model parameters, generate large ensembles of simulated tree-ring chronologies, and embed proxy system modeling within data assimilation approaches to climate reconstruction.  We also provide examples of model applications which permit process-level understanding of tree ring width variations in response to environmental variations and boundary conditions.
